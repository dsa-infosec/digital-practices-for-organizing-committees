# Digital Practices for Organizing Committees
Updated by NYC-DSA Infosec, 3/27/18

This is the set of best practices for Organizing Committee Members within DSA. We do these things to keep our comrades and their sensitive information safe. We know we have a limited number of asks, and that not everyone on an OC will have a background in technology, so we have tried to keep these simple.

- Passwords to all branch accounts must be at least 20 characters long. They must be used for only one account. They must NOT contain the username, any reference to socialism, or any personal references to the users. The best way to generate a password is to take the randomization out of your hands. Use EFFâ€™s Dice-Generated Passwords, or open a random book to four random pages and point to four random words.

- As an alternative to remembering and sharing many passwords, the OC may use a password manager (like Lastpass or 1Password) to store branch passwords. However, the password manager must have a strong password and should use two-factor authentication if at all possible.

- Use Signal (or another end-to-end encrypted method of communication) to share passwords and other sensitive information. Never share this kind of information through social media. 

- A Signal group should be used as the primary chat between OC members for real-time communication.

- OC Members should never share identifiable photos, real names, or personal information of members other than themselves on any public platform.

- Location sharing on all branch social media is to be turned off.

- OC Members who are logged in to DSA accounts on their devices must lock those devices using a method other than facial recognition or fingerprint, which are not legally protected. In addition, Signal should be locked with a password.

- All OC Members should attend at least one digital security training every year.
